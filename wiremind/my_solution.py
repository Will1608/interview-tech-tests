    Coding test: Bookings report for a transportation operator

    Our revenue management solution CAYZN extracts from an inventory system the transport plan of an operator (trains,
    flights or buses with their itineraries, stops and timetable) and allows our users to analyze sales, forecast the
    demand and optimize their pricing.

    In this project you will manipulate related concepts to build a simple report. We will assess your ability to read
    existing code and to understand the data model in order to develop new features. Two items are essential: the final
    result, and the quality of your code.

    Questions and example data are at the bottom of the script. Do not hesitate to modify existing code if needed.

    Good luck!
